Things that don't sync up with the deployed/current/master version:

-> Sidenav/Subnav and Header active property isn't showing properly (we switched to gatsby-link since {Link} from 'gatsby' is only v2 )
          |-> If this doesn't fix itself by syncing with the final master, it should be simple to reprogram!
-> PaginationLinkPrev breaks the IE build: importing reactstrap utils.js causes syntax errors (maybe babel isn't running anythign on it??)
-> UncontrolledCollapse not working on IE (forEach not defined)
-> Images in md aren't showing (possible I don't have them or markdown config needs to include them)
