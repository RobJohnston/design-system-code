Things that don't sync up with the deployed version:

NOTE: the master is not the deployable version right now ??? so most issues will be resolved once the master is the deployable 
version and everything can be benchmarked against it.

-> Search is broken since the plugin that did search is incompatible with older browsers
-> Sidenav/Subnav and Header active link isn't showing (we switched to gatsby-link since {Link} from 'gatsby' is only v2 )
-> PaginationLinkPrev breaks the IE build: importing reactstrap utils.js causes syntax errors (maybe babel isn't running anythign on it??)
-> UncontrolledCollapse not working on IE (forEach not defined)
