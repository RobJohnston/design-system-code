#Input Groups
Extends form controls by adding text, buttons, or button groups on either side of textual inputs, custom selects, and custom file inputs.

##Basic example
<htmlinputgroup1></htmlinputgroup1>

##Sizing
Add the relative form sizing classes to the .input-group itself and contents within will automatically resizeâ€”no need for repeating the form control size classes on each element.
<htmlinputgroup2></htmlinputgroup2>

##Dropdowns and buttons
Dropdowns and buttons can be added to the beginning or end of input groups.
<htmlinputgroup3></htmlinputgroup3>
