#Button group

Group a series of buttons together on a single line with the button group. Add on optional JavaScript radio and checkbox style behavior with [our buttons plugin](/components/buttons/#button-plugin).

##Basic example

Wrap a series of buttons with `.btn` in `.btn-group`.

##Button toolbar

Combine sets of button groups into button toolbars for more complex components. Use utility classes as needed to space out groups, buttons, and more.

Feel free to mix input groups with button groups in your toolbars. Similar to the example above, youâ€™ll likely need some utilities though to space things properly.

##Sizing

Instead of applying button sizing classes to every button in a group, just add `.btn-group-*` to each `.btn-group`, including each one when nesting multiple groups.

##Nesting

Place a `.btn-group` within another `.btn-group` when you want dropdown menus mixed with a series of buttons.

##Vertical variation

Make a set of buttons appear vertically stacked rather than horizontally. **Split button dropdowns are not supported here.**
