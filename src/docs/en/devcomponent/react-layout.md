# Layout
We are utilizing [reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/) for our most basic react components. Reactstrap provides an alternative syntax to traditionally applying a bootstrap class to a div (ex: `<div class="col-md-12"></div>`). Instead it offers a handy tags such as `<Container>`, `<Row>`, and `<Col>`. 

Note: You can make a `Container` fluid by changing `<Container></Container>` to `<Container fluid></Container>`.
