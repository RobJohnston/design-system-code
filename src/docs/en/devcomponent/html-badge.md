# Badges

Badges are bootstrap's small count and labelling component. Aurora gives these badges a new look and feel to better fit with our other components.

## Example

Badges scale to match the size of the immediate parent element by using relative font-sizing and `em` units.
<htmlbadge1 />

Badges can be used as part of links or buttons to provide a counter.
<htmlbadge2 />

## Contextual variations

Add any of the below mentioned modifier classes to change the appearance of a badge.
<htmlbadge3 />
