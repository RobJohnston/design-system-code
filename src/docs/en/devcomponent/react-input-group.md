#Input Groups
Extends form controls by adding text, buttons, or button groups on either side of textual inputs, custom selects, and custom file inputs.

##Basic example
.
<reactinputgroup1 />

##Sizing
Add the relative form sizing classes to the .input-group itself and contents within will automatically resizeâ€”no need for repeating the form control size classes on each element.
<reactinputgroup2 />

##Dropdowns and buttons
Dropdowns and buttons can be added to the beginning or end of input groups.
<reactinputgroup3 />
