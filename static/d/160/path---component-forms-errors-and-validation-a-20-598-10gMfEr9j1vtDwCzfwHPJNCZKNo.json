{"data":{"eng":{"html":"<h1>Errors and Validation</h1>\n<h2>Input Errors</h2>\n<p>Input errors should be displayed in such a way that it is clear to the user that they have made an error, and what and where that error is. To display errors in a form submission, use both error boxes and inline errors. For each error, copy used for both the error box and the inline error should be indentical.</p>\n<h2>Error Boxes</h2>\n<p>As well, have an error box appear at the beginning of the form listing the errors. In the error box specify the number of errors, and list them numerically in the order in which they appear in the form. For each error provide the reason for the error and a link that directs the user to the error. If the user attempts to submit the form with incomplete necessary fields, direct them to this error box.</p>\n<p>Error boxes are styled as follows:</p>\n<p>Rectangle with the same width as the form container. 4px border radius and a stroke of width 1px using the colour #923534. The box has 15px padding. In the top left corner there is a red circle with a white \"x\" icon that is 25px.</p>\n<p>The box heading uses Heading 2 style, and the text uses the paragraph style. Error copy is displayed in a numbered list using ##923534.
