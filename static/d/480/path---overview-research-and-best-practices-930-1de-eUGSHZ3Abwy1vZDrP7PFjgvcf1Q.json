Some browsers have a feature that allows users to override author-defined style sheets with their own style sheet. This means that users can define a custom style sheet that meets their viewing needs. For example, a low-vision user might define a style sheet that renders all<code>&#x3C;P></code>text at 24 points, or a colorblind user might set the background to white and the text to black for maximum contrast. But these measures will not work, or will only work partially, on pages that are formatted using presentation markup. If text color is set using<code>&#x3C;FONT COLOR></code>and headings are set using<code>&#x3C;FONT SIZE></code>and<code>&#x3C;B></code>for emphasis, the user-defined style sheet will have nothing to apply itself to (no paragraph or heading tags). If you set presentation properties using style sheets, users who _need _to customize the page can do so. <a href=\"http://webstyleguide.com/wsg2/type/access.html\">http://webstyleguide.com/wsg2/type/access.html</a></p>\n<h4><strong>Text-rendering</strong></h4>\n<p>Use optimiseLegibility to enable kerning and improve rendering quality.
