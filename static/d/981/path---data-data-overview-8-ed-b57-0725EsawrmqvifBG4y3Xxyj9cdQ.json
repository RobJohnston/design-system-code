A key or legend should be provided for more complex data that may have multiple colours or types of information. Colours and other visual elements should always be kept to a minimum when possible.</p>\n<p>Visuals should only enhance the data, and should never distract. Best practices include eliminating backgrounds, lightening grids, and reducing the number of colours used in a graph.</p>\n<p>If one graph is too complex to represent a certain dataset, the data should be represented in multiple, simple graphs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/gctools-outilsgc/design-system-code/blob/documentation/src/img/examples/Simplicity.png\" alt=\"Do and don&#x27;t image representing data simplicity\"></p>\n<h3>Multiple Formats</h3>\n<p>When you use data visualizations, it is recommended to represent the data in multiple formats where possible. Regardless of the type of visualization you use, a simple data table, or other ways of viewing the raw data, should be available somewhere on the page. This allows users to view and analyze the data in a way that makes the most sense to them, as well as easily identify individual data points.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/gctools-outilsgc/design-system-code/blob/documentation/src/img/examples/Multiple%20Formats.png\" alt=\"Do and don&#x27;t image representing using multiple formats for data\"></p>\n<h2>Labels</h2>\n<h3>Graph Titles</h3>\n<p>Graph and table titles in this design system use the typography style for <a href=\"typography.md\">heading 2. </a>Titles should be as short as possible, and accurately reflect the question the dataset is trying to represent. Titles always use title-case capitalization.</p>\n<h3>Axis Labelling</h3>\n<p>Both the x and y-axes should always be labeled. Labels should be placed outside of the data area. Labels should use simple and clear language, and accurately represent the data being shown. Axis labels use the typographic style for<a href=\"typography.md\"> heading 4</a>.</p>\n<p>For quantitative labels, the unit of measurement should be included in the label.</p>\n<h3>Data Increments</h3>\n<p>Qualitative data values should be labelled in a logical way, such as consecutive months. For quantitative values, they should be labelled using round numbers or decimals that fit the data range. Always include an additional increment greater than the dataset. For quantitative values, axes should always start at 0.When using decimals, round to a maximum of two decimal points whenever possible.</p>\n<p>In some visualizations with many axis points, skipping labels is an effective way to reduce visual clutter. Axis ticks should be separated with sufficient space to clearly read each label. Intervals between labels should always be consistent.</p>\n<p>On the x-axis, value labels should be centered to their corresponding tick mark.

If multiple colours are required, they should be a complimentary palette that are both distinguishable when placed in close proximity.
