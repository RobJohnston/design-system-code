{"data":{"eng":{"html":"<h1>Tables</h1>\n<p>Data tables are used to show a large amount of discreet data with multiple categories. Data can be filtered and ordered using a data table. For any data visualization, the table with raw data should accompany it. Tables are the simplest and most accessible way to display data, and provide specific information about each data set. Tables allow the user to reference individual values, while visualizations are better able to represent trends derived from these values.</p>\n<p>Tables should always include brief but informative titles.</p>\n<p>Tables can be used to display both quantitative and qualitative data.</p>\n<h2>Simple Table</h2>\n<p>Simple tables are the easiest way to display data and provide a clean look on your page.

The table is placed 13px below the title. The table is the width of its container and the height depends on the data and how pagination is handled on the table.</p>\n<p>Header Row: Table headers are displayed in heading 6 (Nunito Sans Bold at 16px) and are left aligned.

The text has a padding of 21px by 27px. The heading row has a bottom border of 2px using the colour (#96a8b2). Each row has a bottom border of 1px using the colour (#96a8b2)</p>\n<h2>Striped Table</h2>\n<p>Striped tables are often used to improve readability.

Data tables use the simple table template, with added interactive elements. The most common interactions to include in a data table are sorting icons or a checkbox column. Only include a checkbox column if there are actions to perform on a specific row of data.</p>\n<p>If checkboxes are included in the table, active rows should be highlighted with a fill of #F2F5F6</p>\n<p>Some other examples of interactive elements to add to a data table are: pagination, filters, search bars, icon buttons, sorting icons, etc.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/gctools-outilsgc/design-system/blob/master/documentation/examples/interactive%20table_1.png\" alt=\"Interactive data table 1\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/gctools-outilsgc/design-system/blob/master/documentation/examples/interactive%20table_2.png\" alt=\"Interactive data table 2\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/gctools-outilsgc/design-system/blob/master/documentation/examples/interactive%20table_3.png\" alt=\"Interactive data table 3\"></p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"h1","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Tables"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Data tables are used to show a large amount of discreet data with multiple categories.
