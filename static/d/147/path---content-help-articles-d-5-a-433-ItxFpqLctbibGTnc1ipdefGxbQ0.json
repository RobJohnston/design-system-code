{"data":{"eng":{"html":"<h1>Help Articles</h1>\n<p>(This style guide is currently for Freshdesk. It will be updated and changed to suit the design system).</p>\n<h3>Titles</h3>\n<p>All article names/titles should be written in the form of a question. For example:</p>\n<p>•    How can I create an account?</p>\n<p>•    How do I use Search?</p>\n<p>If the article can answer more than one complete question, you should split it in to multiple articles.</p>\n<p> Headings and Text</p>\n<p>•    Font is the default Helvetica Neue</p>\n<p>•    Always use the pre-set Freshdesk format options. Don’t use font sizes (i.e.  Not “12pt”).</p>\n<p>o    Main Headings (Top Level) are Heading 2. Major sections should have headings.</p>\n<p>o    Subheadings are Heading 3 and bolded. Subsections should have subheadings.</p>\n<p>o    All other text is Normal.</p>\n<p>•    Quotation marks are used when explaining something to be typed (ex. “@”)</p>\n<p>•    Bolded words in text refer to buttons the user will click (e.g. Post)</p>\n<p>•    Text is in black with white background, unless other colours are necessary to improve comprehension.</p>\n<p>o    Tables are in grey scale (see section).</p>\n<p>o    Hyperlinks are blue (see section).</p>\n<p> Notes, Tips and Warnings</p>\n<p>•    Notes are in italics. Notes should also appear in brackets (e.g. (Note: This format)).</p>\n<p>o    Notes are information that supplement the main text. They should not describe actions the user will take, but rather give information which answers questions the user may have.</p>\n<p>    Example: (Note: A group operator must be a member of the group).</p>\n<p>o    Notes should appear in-line with the text they directly refer to.</p>\n<p>o    Notes should appear after the text block they refer to if they answer a more general question about the instructions.</p>\n<p>o    Notes should appear before images that they refer to.</p>\n<p>•    Tips are to be placed in this info box/example:</p>\n<p>You are able to preview how your blog post will look before publishing by selecting Preview.</p>\n<p>o    Tips are suggestions for the user. They aren’t necessary steps, but describe actions which may help the reader.</p>\n<p>o    The text in the tip box should vertically aligned in the center and left-aligned.</p>\n<p>•    Warnings are to be placed in this info box/example:</p>\n<p> If you delete your account, any contributions that you have made to GCconnex will also be lost with your account. Consider deactivating your account as an alternative to fully deleting it.</p>\n<p>o    Warnings are issues that may arise. They may be errors, lost data, actions which are permanent or other problems. The text should also explain how to avoid these issues.</p>\n<p>o    Typically, warnings should be placed before the text they are associated with.</p>\n<p>o    The text in the warning box should be bolded, and vertically aligned in the center and left-aligned.</p>\n<p>Paragraph Format</p>\n<p>•    All text should be left aligned.</p>\n<p>•    There should be no line breaks between headings, subheadings and paragraph text.</p>\n<p>•    Always use single space. Spacing is exaggerated when the article is ported to GCcollab and GCconnex.</p>\n<p>•    Single space between paragraphs or sections.</p>\n<p>•    No spacing between subtitles and their following paragraph text.</p>\n<p>•    No indenting for headings, subheadings or paragraphs.</p>\n<p>Lists</p>\n<p>•    Non-ordered lists should be bulleted. They should appear with a single indent and a black dot.</p>\n<p>o    For points that elaborate on a previous bullet, use the unfilled bullet and double indent.</p>\n<p>o    Non-ordered lists should be preceded by an introductory sentence followed by a colon.</p>\n<p>o    These lists should be parallel in sentence structure/tense whenever possible and end with punctuation.</p>\n<p>•    Sequential lists/steps should be numbered in order. They should appear with a single indent.</p>\n<p>o    Steps should only contain one action unless the actions are very closely related.</p>\n<p>o    Whenever possible begin each step with the verb. End each step with punctuation.</p>\n<p>o    Lists may be broken up by images.</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p>Press the numbered list key.</p>\n<p>Type the first step.</p>\n<p>Press the space bar.</p>\n<p>Type the second step.</p>\n<p>Continue as needed.</p>\n<p>Images</p>\n<p>Images should be:</p>\n<p>•    Sized for readability. Typically 700px in width (as this size ports best to GCcollab and GCconnex) unless stretching to this size makes the image hard to read.</p>\n<p>•    Center aligned and break the text.</p>\n<p>•    Below the text/step they are associated with.</p>\n<p>•    Uncaptioned.</p>\n<p>•    In the correct language (i.e. French articles should have French images and vice versa).</p>\n<p>How to insert and format an image (with examples of how to place it):</p>\n<p>Move your cursor to the end of the line of text you would like your image to reside below. (Note: You cannot drag images).</p>\n<p>Click the insert image icon.</p>\n<p>Locate and select the image you want to insert.</p>\n<p>Click on the image in order to reveal an options menu.</p>\n<p>Click the change size icon.</p>\n<p>Resize to “700px” width if appropriate.</p>\n<p>Click Display (the star) to make sure the image is formatted Break Text.</p>\n<p>Click Align (the lines) and choose center.</p>\n<p>Screenshots and Image Elements</p>\n<p>•    Screenshots should be large enough that the user will understand the context and surroundings of the image.</p>\n<p>•    Use a photo editing software (ex. Microsoft Paint) to make one of three symbols to point out different elements:</p>\n<p>o    Circle: to show a button the user needs to click.</p>\n<p>o    Rectangle: to bring attention to a large area, or multiple buttons or tabs.</p>\n<p>o    Arrow:  Bring attention to a general area of a page, or to a circle or box that is not emphasised enough.</p>\n<p>Tables</p>\n<p>o    Use normal format</p>\n<p>o    Make sure cell sizes do not create breaks within words.</p>\n<p>o    Put a space before and after text so that text does not look crowded.</p>\n<p>o    Center the text both vertically and horizontally in the cell.</p>\n<p>o    Headers should be bolded.</p>\n<p>o    Tables are in grey scale.</p>\n<p>o    Header cells are cool grey.</p>\n<p>o    Other cells are light grey.</p>\n<p>o    Warm grey may be used in cells if further distinction is required.</p>\n<p>Example of a table:</p>\n<p>Button    Result</p>\n<p>Main page    Brings you to the GCpedia home page</p>\n<p>Communities</p>\n<p>View an index of communities that are using GCpedia cross-departmentally</p>\n<p>Browse categories</p>\n<p>View all categories created by users</p>\n<p>Random page    View a random GCpedia page</p>\n<p>Hyperlinks</p>\n<p>•    Hyperlinks are in blue.</p>\n<p>•    When a user clicks a link to take them to a site or other article, we want it to be in a new tab. To do this:</p>\n<p>To first add the link click the link icon (or press Ctrl K).</p>\n<p>Fill in the appropriate information.</p>\n<p>Go into code view.</p>\n<p>Go to the source of the tag.</p>\n<p>Add this element into the code: &#x3C;href> tag: target=”_blank”</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<p>&#x3C;href=”<a href=\"https://gccollab.ca/newsfeed/%E2%80%9D&#x26;gt\">https://gccollab.ca/newsfeed/”></a>; Click Here! &#x3C;/href></p>\n<p>Becomes</p>\n<p>&#x3C;href=”<a href=\"https://gccollab.ca/newsfeed/%E2%80%9D\">https://gccollab.ca/newsfeed/”</a> target=”_blank”> Click Here! &#x3C;/href></p>\n<p>Tags</p>\n<p>•    Start with the most general which is the platform the article is for (GCcollab, GCconnex, etc.)</p>\n<p>•    Work from general to specific.</p>\n<p>•    Make sure you have equivalent tags in French as well.</p>\n<p>•    Tags are used not only to search for articles, but also to populate the Related Articles sidebar. Keep this in mind while tagging articles; consider which articles are useful to show together.</p>\n<p>Style for Terms and Grammar</p>\n<p>These terms are written as such:</p>\n<p>•    Dropdown</p>\n<p>•    Eg.</p>\n<p>•    Email</p>\n<p>•    Cog icon (not settings icon)</p>\n<p>•    Keywords</p>\n<p>•    Members (not users)</p>\n<p>•    On the page (not in)</p>\n<p>•    Profile (not profile page)</p>\n<p>•    Profile card</p>\n<p>•    Avatar (not profile icon)</p>\n<p>•    Trashcan</p>\n<p>•    URL</p>\n<p>•    Username</p>\n<p>Stylistic grammar rules:</p>\n<p>•    Commas: Use sparingly and only when necessary to improve comprehension. No Oxford comma.</p>\n<p>•    Hyphens/Semi-colons: Use sparingly, usually a period will suffice.</p>\n<p>•    Periods/Punctuation: End every sentence with some form of punctuation.</p>\n<p>•    Describing User Interactions</p>\n<p>•    User interactions should use precise and consistent terminology.</p>\n<p>Term    Description     Example    Other notes</p>\n<p>Check    Used for selecting checkboxes.     Check “I have read the terms and conditions.”</p>\n<p>Check all options that apply.     Can be used for a single option to confirm, or turn something on or off, and multiple options.</p>\n<p>Click    Using the mouse or trackpad to select buttons and links.    Click Submit.     Do not use “click on”</p>\n<p>Press    Used for mechanical keys on the keyboard.     Press Ctrl-C.</p>\n<p>Select    Used when choosing an item in a list or a radio button.    In the More menu, select Group Docs.    Use when only one option can be selected.</p>\n<p>Type    Used when the user inputs characters from the keyboard.    Type your username into the text field.</p>\n<p>Language and Grammar</p>\n<p>•    Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely known.</p>\n<p>•    Use the active voice.</p>\n<p>•    Don’t attribute human qualities to software or hardware.</p>\n<p>•    <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/style/anthropomorphism\">https://developers.google.com/style/anthropomorphism</a></p>\n<p>•    Don’t use all caps for emphasis, underline.</p>\n<p>•    Mention the circumstance before the action when it is relevant.</p>\n<p>•    Use present tense as much as possible.</p>\n<p>•    Careful w/ pronouns</p>\n<p>•    Clear?</p>\n<p>•    Cancel vs. end vs. stop.</p>","htmlAst":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"h1","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Help Articles"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"(This style guide is currently for Freshdesk.
